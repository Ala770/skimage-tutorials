      "# Parsing pixels with scikit-image\n",
      "\n",
      "Presented by **St\u00e9fan van der Walt <stefanv@berkeley.edu>**<br/>\n",
      "<hr/>\n",
      "\n",
      "This tutorial can be found online at [https://github.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials](https://github.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials)\n",
      "\n",
      "Please launch the IPython notebook *from the root of the repository*.\n",
      "<hr/>\n",
      "\n",
      "From telescopes to satellite cameras to electron microscopes, scientists are producing more images than they can manually inspect. This tutorial will introduce automated image analysis using the \"images as numpy arrays\" abstraction, run through various fundamental image analysis operations (filters, morphology, segmentation), and finally give you a chance to try your hand at some real-world examples from StackOverflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image analysis is central to a boggling number of scientific endeavors. Google needs it for their self-driving cars and to match satellite imagery and mapping data. Neuroscientists need it to understand the brain. NASA needs it to [map asteroids](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26528516) and save the human race. It is, however, a relatively underdeveloped area of scientific computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is for attendees to leave the tutorial confident of their ability to extract information from images in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Prerequisites\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the below packages, including the non-Python ones, can be found in the [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Python distribution, which can be obtained for free.\n",
      "Alternatively, under OSX, a ``pip install`` should work.\n",

      "### Example images\n",
      "\n",
      "scikit-image ships with some example images in `skimage.data`. For this tutorial, we will additionally make use of images included in the `images` directory of the `skimage-tutorials/images` folder.\n",
